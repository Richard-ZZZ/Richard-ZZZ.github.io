# About me
Starting in **January 2025**, I joined the **Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics** at **Johns Hopkins University** as an assistant professor. 
Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Scientist in the **Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research** at **Columbia University** (Sep 2023–Dec 2024), working with **Prof. Xunyu Zhou**. 
I completed my Ph.D. in the **Department of Mathematics** at **The University of Texas at Austin**, advised by **Prof. Thaleia Zariphopoulou**. 
Before that, I studied **Mathematics and Applied Mathematics** (Honors Program) at **Xi’an Jiaotong University**, and participated in the **Special Class for the Gifted Young**.

My research centers on data‑driven decision making under uncertainty, stochastic/robust optimization, and machine learning. Specific themes include:  
- Decision making with contextual side information and robust guarantees, with applications in supply chains, revenue management, and fairness.  
- Optimal information acquisition via stochastic control, balancing costly learning and expected returns, with links to mechanism design and robo‑advising.
